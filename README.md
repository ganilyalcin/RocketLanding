# RocketLanding 

Hello!

Framework is .NET 4.6.1 unfortunately. I could not make it with xUnit and .Net Core because I'm having some problems with the SDKs in my PC right now. I did not have the time to fix them.


<h3>The Library : RocketLanding.Service</h3>


Unit tests includes all the cases written on the definition.
